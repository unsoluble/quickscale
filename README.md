# QuickScale

_A small module for quickly adjusting the scale of things._

---

Select elements in a scene, then use the square bracket keys to tweak them (with or without `Shift` for different effects).

### Controls

Under Foundry v9 or newer, all keybinds can be configured in the core Configure Controls window. Keys listed below are the defaults.

Under v8, custom keybinds are available with the use of the [Library: DF Hotkeys](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/lib-df-hotkeys) module.


### Tokens & Tiles

- `[` and `]` will adjust tokens or tiles incrementally. **PF2E Note:** If you have `Link to Actor Size` enabled in a token's configuration, QuickScale will not be able to change that token's scale.
- Will work with multiple selections.
- `Shift + [` will apply a small amount of random scaling to all controlled tokens or tiles.
- `Shift + ]` will apply a small amount of random rotation.]
- If one or more tokens are controlled, `Shift + \` will save the tokens' current scale to their actors' Prototype Token config.
- `Alt + [` will nudge the token art down relative to the grid square (useful for isometric-style artwork).
- `Alt + ]` will nudge up.

- `Alt + Shift + [` will nudge down in larger steps.
- `Alt + Shift + ]` nudges up in large steps.
- `Alt + \` will reset the nudged offset to zero.

### Lights & Sounds

- `[` and `]` will adjust their radius in 1-grid-unit steps.
- `Shift + [` and `Shift + ]` will adjust them in 5-grid-unit steps.
- Lights can be adjusted into the negative, to create Darkness lights.

### Templates

- Same controls as for Lights & Sounds, adjusting the `distance` property of templates.
- Is a little weird with rectangles, because of how they're constructed.
- Non-GM/Assistant players may use these controls on their own placed templates.

### Settings

There are a few settings you can adjust:

![Settings](doc/Settings.png)

- _Token Scale Randomization Range_ sets the minimum and maximum scale values that tokens will randomize within.
- _Tile Scale Randomization Range_ sets similar bounds for the tile randomization tool.
- _Maximum Rotation Amount_ sets the bounds for random rotations — a value of 15 here will allow for random changes between -15° and 15°.
